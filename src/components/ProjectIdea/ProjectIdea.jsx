          <h2>Technomancer’s Project Roles </h2>
          <p>The Technomancer’s project was based off the existing design work already completed by team member Sam Bruce. We were all impressed by the idea and the extent with which Sam had already progressed with his project. Since then, we have worked together as a team to further discuss the progress of Duckypass and how this device could progress to a completed marketed product. Technomancer’s general processes are to always work collaboratively and to assign work as we progress with our project discussions. The Technomancer’s work collaboratively at most times however as Sam B quite rightly has taken the role of Lead Developer and Technical Developer. As we all discuss the project together in our meetings most team members in particular Sam K, Damian and Ally take on such roles as Technical developer and User Interface Designer. This happens naturally as we work through the project requirements together. Ally has taken on work that involves researching and project coordination. Sarah S has mostly worked in the role as a project coordinator, coordinating meetings and agenda; and has also taken on research where required to assist with the delivery of our project.</p>
