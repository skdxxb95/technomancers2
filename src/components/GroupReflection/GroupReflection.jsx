            <p>Reflecting on the recent group assignment, I feel proud of how well our team was able to communicate and support one another throughout the process. Even though we faced challenges with discrepancies in university enrolment, we were able to work through them together and keep each other motivated. I also recognize that our morale could have been improved during and after the emotional dip that we experienced. It was challenging to stay positive and focused, but I am proud of our ability to come together and muster up the motivation needed to finish the assignment. Through this experience, I have learned the importance of contributing to a team and being a supportive member. I now understand that working in a group can not only be effective in getting work done, but also provide a great support network. I am grateful for the opportunity to work with such a great team and for the lessons that I have learned. One aspect of the assignment that I found surprising was how evenly distributed the work was despite the difficulties we faced. However, I do not think that the GitHub log accurately represents the distribution of work. In my opinion, it was definitely an even split and I think we all contributed equally to the project. </p>
