            <p>I feel we have struggled to get into Assignment 3, and that the direction we need to take was harder to articulate and understand than with Assignment 2. We lost a team member as they withdrew from the course. And on top of that, the morale of our team was deeply impacted by the way we were treated by RMIT administration with regards to moving froward with enrolment. This has regrettably negatively impacted on the morale and overall wellbeing of our team. We were able to get past this and again work well as a team and contribute to completion. We have all been willing to ask for help. This is important when working in a team that workload support is a two way street. </p>

            <p>Reflecting on the recent group assignment, I feel proud of how well our team was able to communicate and support one another throughout the process. Even though we faced challenges with discrepancies in university enrolment, we were able to work through them together and keep each other motivated. I also recognize that our morale could have been improved during and after the emotional dip that we experienced. It was challenging to stay positive and focused, but I am proud of our ability to come together and muster up the motivation needed to finish the assignment. Through this experience, I have learned the importance of contributing to a team and being a supportive member. I now understand that working in a group can not only be effective in getting work done, but also provide a great support network. I am grateful for the opportunity to work with such a great team and for the lessons that I have learned. One aspect of the assignment that I found surprising was how evenly distributed the work was despite the difficulties we faced. However, I do not think that the GitHub log accurately represents the distribution of work. In my opinion, it was definitely an even split and I think we all contributed equally to the project. </p>

            <h2>Ally H.</h2>
            <p>I think we work well as group. The team morale was badly affected by the not knowing what was happening with the Bachelor of IT that some of us were planning on going on with. Also, the grading from our last assignment as it was felt that some parts that we lost grades on were not clearly defined in the assignment description. I think this is probably a part of academic learning though and we are to be expected to know these things. Losing a team member was also a blow but understandable with the difficulties we had with all our work commitments and an 11 hour time difference.  But we have persevered, pulled together and continued to work as a team to complete our assignments.  </p>
