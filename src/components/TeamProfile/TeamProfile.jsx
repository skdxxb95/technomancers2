          <h5>Reflection on our last assignment and career plans.</h5>
          <div>
            <h2>Group Processes</h2>
            <p>
            The Technomancer’s worked well together in our first group project for Introduction to Information Technology. Although we all have different skills to bring differing perspective was helpful when discussing the project direction. We discussed the different roles that we can all play in delivering the Duckypass product to completion and how these roles can change as we all contribute to the end result.  
            <br></br>
            We communicated well as we did in our previous project. We had an ongoing conversation and stayed in touch as much as possible checking in on the status of work and working through what we needed to action in order to complete the project on time.  
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Career Plans</h2>
            <p>Discussion with the group indicates that there is no real significant shift in our ideal job outcomes after completing assignment 1 and 2. We all feel that we will remain on course to continue learning more about our ideal roles and what is required to achieve success.</p> 
            <br></br>
            <p>All job prospects of our team members involve skills in analysis or problem-solving, strong communication skills, and the ability to work as an integral and high functioning member of a team.</p>
            <br></br> 
            <p>As a group there are also some differences among our career aspirations, in particular with the type of industry pathways we wish to pursue and the technologies we may focus on. The differences that also stand out are the specific skills pathway such as cyber security and software development.</p>
            <br></br> 
            <p>Also, some of the roles we all wish to pursue would require varied levels of experience to achieve the desired role, which means that we would need to pursue other entry level roles first to gain the required experience before being ready to take on our ideal job.</p>
            <br></br> 
            <p>As mentioned in our previous assignment, despite the differences, our ideal jobs are all important components of an IT development software pathway. And can all contribute in different ways to the successful delivery of a software solution.</p>

            <p>
            My opinion of my ideal job has not changed. The role’s skill set will continue to grow into the future as a required and in demand role in any industry, not just health care. This information assisted in understanding the skill areas that I will need to expand on.

            <p>
            After looking into burning glass data, I can safely say that my ideal job will be remaining the same, as it is one that I hold close to my goals in life, while my ideal job has not changed, the option to further expand my knowledge in other areas has become apparent with the information provided about burning glass data. As stated above, any form of change to my ideal career path would be at most only very minor.

            <h2>Sam B.</h2>
            <p>As someone who has recently completed their studies in cybersecurity, I have made the decision to further my education and skills in software development by enrolling in a Bachelor of IT program at RMIT. Both fields have always interested me, and I believe that combining my knowledge and skills in both areas will make me a valuable asset in the workforce. After researching data from Burning Glass, I am even more certain that pursuing a career in software development with a focus on cybersecurity is the right path for me. In today's workforce, it is crucial to have a diverse range of skills and knowledge, and I am confident that my background in cybersecurity and my interest in software development will make me an asset to any organization. To ensure that I am providing the best possible service to my future clients or employers, I am committed to continuing my education and staying up to date on the latest developments and trends in both fields.</p>

            Possibly. My ideal job is one I can do remotely, but I am finding security and coding fascinating. I will reserve my decision until I have furthered my studies somewhat. The more I study the more interesting the whole gamut of IT becomes.

            After trawling through more webpages than I care to count and reading more in the last 2 weeks then I have in the last 2 years (and that is a lot) I am not going to change my opinion on my chosen ideal job. It has however presented several options and steppingstones to my ideal job. And Highlighted a few extra skills I should acquire on the journey.
